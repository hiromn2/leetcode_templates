#To convert a top-down solution to a bottom-up one:

Initialize an array 
dp
dp that is sized according to the state variables. For example, let's say the input to the problem was an array 
nums
nums and an integer 
k
k that represents the maximum number of actions allowed. Your array 
dp
dp would be 2D with one dimension of length 
nums.length
nums.length and the other of length 
k
k. In the top-down approach, we had a function dp. We want these two to be equivalent. For example, the value of dp(4, 6) can now be found in dp[4][6].

Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function. In the example we just looked at, we had dp(0) = dp(1) = 0. We can initialize our dp array values to 0 to implicitly set this base case. As you'll see soon, other problems will have more complicated base cases.

Write a for-loop(s) that iterate over your state variables. If you have multiple state variables, you will need nested for-loops. These loops should start iterating from the base cases and end at the answer state.

Now, each iteration of the inner-most loop represents a given state, and is equivalent to a function call to the same state in top-down. Copy-paste the logic from your function into the for-loop and change the function calls to accessing your array. All 
dp(...)
dp(...) changes into 
dp[...]
dp[...].

We're done! 
dp
dp is now an array populated with the answer to the original problem for all possible states. Return the answer to the original problem, by changing 
return dp(...)
return dp(...) to 
return dp[...]
return dp[...].
